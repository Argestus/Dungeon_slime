# Dungeon slime
This project was started so I could implement what I've learned during my JavaScript lectures. The idea is simple: create a simple dungeon crawler type game that uses as much as possible from my lectures. 

In this game you are a slime navigating a hostile environment in a top down view. The initial idea is just a simple map in a grid pattern. If it goes well I might try to implement a hexagonal map. The best outcome would be if I could generate a random map each time you play.
